        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          The Santa Catarina River (SCR) is a meandering lotic river in the Bravo–San Juan basin in Nuevo León, northeast
          Mexico. It originates in the La Purísima canyon of the San José range and flows into the San Juan River across
          approximately 160 kilometers. In the Monterrey Metropolitan Area (MMA) it crosses the municipalities of
          Santiago, Santa Catarina, San Pedro, Monterrey, Guadalupe, Juárez, and Cadereyta.
        </p>
        <p>
          The SCR channel has been targeted by ambitious state and municipal projects. Urban growth across the 20th
          century fueled indiscriminate modification of the riverbed through infrastructure works that threaten water
          security and biodiversity. The most intense attempts to repurpose the SCR for urban entertainment and informal
          commerce occurred between the second half of the last century and 2010. Seasonal storms and hurricanes
          (Gilberto, Emily, and Alex in 1988, 2005, and 2010) have since reinforced the river’s role as a flood hazard,
          especially for downtown Monterrey and Guadalupe.
        </p>
        <p>
          Urbanization has reduced per-capita green space and complicated planning efforts. In Mexican cities,
          planning often reacts after rapid urban growth has already created deficits. The Santa Catarina River corridor
          now sits at the intersection of public pressure, ecological rights, and the need for water security.

        <h2>Context and Background</h2>
        <p>
          A growing “One Health” movement in Monterrey links human health with ecological integrity. Recent protests
          against the transformation of Parque Libertad into a hospital illustrate how citizens prioritize access to green
          space alongside healthcare.
        </p>
        <p>
          Urbanization is a primary driver of biodiversity loss. Semi-arid cities can still retain native plant and bird
          diversity, even in marginal conditions, which makes urban restoration and conservation opportunities critical.
        </p>
        <p>
          Restoration studies show that urban river recovery improves water quality, biodiversity, and ecosystem
          services. More complex riparian landscapes support richer bird communities, and the Santa Catarina River
          connects several protected natural areas such as Cerro de las Mitras, La Huasteca, and Cumbres de Monterrey.
        </p>
        <p>
          A persistent challenge is the dominance of exotic plant species. In the Santa Catarina River, the successional
          stage is arrested by introduced species across all strata. Key exotics include <em>Leucaena leucocephala</em>,
          <em>Ricinus communis</em>, <em>Cyperus involucratus</em>, and <em>Melinis repens</em>. Research also emphasizes that native
          trees and native
          grasses most strongly support bird diversity, while higher pedestrian activity reduces richness and abundance of
          non-synanthropic birds.

        <h2>Objectives</h2>
        <ul class="project-highlights">
          <li>Estimate bird richness and biodiversity for different vegetation types and structures.</li>
          <li>Evaluate differences among communities using Hill numbers and the Chao–Sorensen similarity index.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
        <p>
          Native riparian forest patches increase bird diversity because they represent ecologically important sites. Lower
          richness is expected in exotic vegetation and treeless sites, along with low community similarity and a higher
          percentage of exclusive species in riparian forest and tree-covered areas.

        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <h3>Study Area and Sampling</h3>
        <p>
          The study polygon is centered at N 25° 40' 8.9436 / W 100° 17' 39.0984 in one of the most disturbed sections
          of the SCR. It spans 1.27 square kilometers and extends approximately 8.02 kilometers east–west across
          central Monterrey.
        </p>

        <figure class="project-figure">

          <figcaption>
            <strong>Graph 1.</strong> Map of the study area and the 40 point-count locations with 40-meter radius buffers.

        </figure>

        <p>
          Sampling took place during the first four days of April 2024, after winter migrants had departed. Forty
          randomized point counts with a 40-meter radius were conducted. Counts were performed by four to six observers
          over five minutes, after a three-minute settling period. Species were identified by sight and vocalizations. Points
          were numbered from east to west, beginning in Guadalupe, Nuevo León. The total sample size was 39 because
          point 35 was inaccessible.
        </p>

        <h3>Spatial Analysis and Vegetation Variables</h3>
        <p>
          Spatial data and classifications were provided by Sociedad Sostenible, A.C. (SOSAC). Eighteen land-use and
          vegetation classes were consolidated into three categories: riparian forest (RF), exotic vegetation (EV), and no
          apparent vegetation (NAV). Riparian forest includes woody genera such as <em>Salix</em>, <em>Populus</em>, and to a lesser extent
          <em>Platanus</em>, as well as native secondary riparian shrubs like mesquite and palo verde. Exotic vegetation includes
          African grasslands, reed beds, extensive castor-bean fields, palms, and guaje trees. NAV includes exposed clay
          and gravel riverbeds and paved patches from channelization.
        </p>

        <figure class="project-figure">
          <img src="images/santa-catarina/35.png" alt="Vegetation composition chart" />
          <figcaption>
            <strong>Graph 2.</strong> Vegetation composition across the study area. Categories: riparian forest, exotic
            vegetation, no apparent vegetation, and water bodies.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Of the 39 point counts, 22 were classified as exotic vegetation, nine as no apparent vegetation, and eight as
          riparian forest. The sampling extent contained 46% exotic vegetation, 26% NAV, 25% riparian forest, and 3%
          water bodies. Detectability issues in dense vegetation led to excluding NAV points from comparisons. Analyses
          focused on riparian forest versus exotic vegetation.
        </p>

        <p>
          To evaluate the role of tree cover, sites were also categorized by the presence of at least one tree. Tree cover
          was based on patches of riparian forest sensu stricto (cottonwood, willow, and sycamore). Twenty-six sites had
          at least one tree and 13 sites lacked woody vegetation.
        </p>

        <h3>Diversity Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          Bird diversity was estimated using Hill numbers: observed richness (q0), the exponential of Shannon (q1), and
          the inverse of Simpson (q2). Chao 1 was used to estimate species richness, emphasizing rare species. Sampling
          completeness was calculated as observed richness divided by estimated richness. EstimateS 9.10 provided
          bootstrap confidence intervals (1,000 iterations), while PAST4.0 supplied analytical confidence intervals for
          diversity indices. Community similarity was quantified using Chao–Sorensen. Aquatic bird species were excluded
          to reduce observer bias.

        <h2>Discussion</h2>
        <p>
          No sampling effort can detect every species in a community, especially when rare species are common. The
          study was more representative for tree-covered versus treeless comparisons than for riparian forest versus
          exotic vegetation. Exotic vegetation exhibited lower detection and likely reflects the vast riverbed dominated by
          castor bean, reeds, and other introduced species. Riparian forest patches were few, small, and isolated, which
          may artificially increase completeness indices. Overall, the study indicates the need for a greater sampling
          effort to capture the full richness of terrestrial birds in the SCR.
        </p>
        <p>
          Differences in bird diversity may be more visible when vegetation structure is considered alongside vegetation
          type. Simultaneous evaluation of both composition and structure tends to yield better results in urban bird
          diversity studies.
        </p>
        <p>
          The survey recorded 31 terrestrial bird species and nine aquatic species, representing about 20% of the
          resident bird species of Nuevo León. The most abundant families were Columbidae, Icteridae, and Tyrannidae.
          Tyrannidae was also the richest family. Species with conservation status or regional endemism include the
          Green Parakeet (<em>Psittacara holochlorus</em>, listed as Threatened in NOM-059-SEMARNAT-2010), along with the
          Olive Sparrow (<em>Arremonops rufivirgatus</em>) and Broad-billed Hummingbird (<em>Cynanthus latirostris</em>).
        </p>
        <p>
          Compared with other riparian studies in the MMA, the recorded richness is low and likely reflects limited
          sampling. For example, a two-year survey in the La Silla River recorded 152 species, and iNaturalist data lists
          117 species for the SCR. Observer effects also influenced detection: up to six observers were present at some
          points, and sound-based abundance estimates relied on human judgment. These factors likely contributed to
          variability in abundance estimates.
        </p>
        <p>
          Riparian forests in arid urban landscapes support higher bird diversity, and the SCR follows this pattern:
          tree-covered sites showed significantly greater richness and diversity than treeless sites. Species such as
          <em>Pitangus sulfuratus</em>, <em>Melanerpes aurifrons</em>, and <em>Spinus psaltria</em> were recorded frequently in tree-covered sites.
          Introduced species like the House Sparrow (<em>Passer domesticus</em>) also concentrated in riparian forest. Treeless
          sites were used by native species as well, including House Finch (<em>Haemorhous mexicanus</em>), which used large
          aster patches for foraging.

        <h2>Conclusions</h2>
        <p>
          The study emphasizes the ecological importance of native riparian trees for bird diversity in the Santa Catarina
          River. Tree-covered sites consistently supported higher richness and diversity in several analyses. However, the
          sampling effort was insufficient to fully capture terrestrial bird richness. Future studies should expand sampling,
          incorporate more robust statistical designs, and evaluate vegetation structure and composition more precisely
          (for example, using distance sampling to reduce detectability bias). Multi-season surveys are recommended to
          capture total diversity across the SCR.
        </p>
        <p>
          The SCR faces significant challenges from urbanization and poor vegetation management. Conservation of its
          biodiversity and water security depends on evidence-based urban planning. The hypothesis that exotic vegetation
          patches host lower diversity than riparian forest patches cannot be rejected, raising questions about aggressive
          removal strategies that are not informed by rigorous ecological data.
