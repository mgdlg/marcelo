        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The Santa Catarina River is a meandering intermittent river in the Bravo–San Juan River basin in northeast
          Mexico. In the Monterrey Metropolitan Area, it crosses the municipalities of Santiago, Santa Catarina, San
          Pedro, Monterrey, Guadalupe, Juárez, and Cadereyta.
        </p>
        <p>
          Historically, the river has been subject to interventions that have exacerbated environmental injustice in the
          city, to the extent that it has been targeted by ambitious state and municipal projects that lack democratic
          representation and scientific input.
        </p>
        <p>
          Urban planning in Mexican cities has been demonstrated to be reactive; cities grow first and plan second.
          Monterrey is no exception. Urbanization has reduced per-capita green space and complicated planning efforts,
          which often react after rapid urban growth has already created deficits. The Santa Catarina River corridor now
          sits at the intersection of public pressure, ecological rights, and the need for environmental security.
        </p>
        <p>
          The river currently faces a major challenge: indiscriminate modification of the riverbed through infrastructure
          works threatens water security and biodiversity.
        </p>
        <p>
          At present, the main interest of the new administrations is to develop the space as a linear urban park.
          However, there are valid arguments from the public against this approach. First, the privatization of public
          spaces in the city of Monterrey is an increasingly pressing problem; an example is Fundidora Park, whose
          privatization further reduces the amount of green space per capita for citizens. Second, and even more
          importantly, the morphological changes induced by urban development projects have diminished the capacity of the
          riverbed and, therefore, have made further modifications to the built environment impossible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meteorological events that bring heavy rains to the state in spring and summer have historically posed
          significant challenges to incorporating the river system into state and municipal public projects. Within the
          historical record of the city of Monterrey, major hurricanes include Gilberto, Emily, and Alex (1988, 2005,
          and 2010, respectively).
        </p>
        <p>
          These episodic extreme events make infrastructure projects in the river basin fiscally unfeasible for local
          governments. When the government stopped manipulating the river channel, an unexpected ecological outcome
          emerged: a living river mosaic.
        </p>
        <p>
          In recent years, the social momentum of the alternative scientific paradigm “One Health” has become
          increasingly visible in the city, as mass mobilizations argue that human and environmental health are
          inseparable.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started this project as an initiative to continue propelling the political and scientific momentum of
          citizen-led movements around the river. This project is guided by the following question: what if we could
          measure and visualize precisely how much this river mosaic has blossomed within a largely homogeneous landscape
          of asphalt and concrete?
        </p>
        <p>
          The objective is to replicate the methodology developed by Bryan E. Morgan and colleagues in their publication
          “Spatiotemporal analysis of vegetation cover change in a large ephemeral river: Multi-sensor fusion of
          unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and Landsat imagery.” The idea is to use community-based UAV cartography to
          calibrate and downscale Landsat imagery and quantify how much greener the river basin has become since the last
          major hurricane in 2010.
