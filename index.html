        I work at the intersection of <strong>GIS</strong>, <strong>remote sensing</strong>, and
        <strong>field ecology</strong>, supporting environmental impact assessments, reforestation
        monitoring, and urban biodiversity research. Below is a selection of projects where I’ve
        combined spatial analysis, scripting in R/Python, and on-the-ground surveys to answer

        <h2>Urbanization Index & Blackbird Phenotypes</h2>
        <p class="project-meta">

        <p>
          In this project, I integrated <strong>geospatial analysis</strong> into an Urbanization Index
          used to study phenotypic variation in <em>Turdus merula</em> (Eurasian blackbird) across an
          urban–rural gradient. The goal was to quantify how urban structure shapes body condition and
          morphology, and to relate these patterns to landscape composition around sampling sites.
        </p>

        <p>
          I constructed spatial layers describing land cover, green space, building density, and
          fragmentation around each sampling point. These variables were then combined into an
          Urbanization Index, which we linked to biometric metrics such as body mass, tarsus length,
          wing measurements, and feather condition. Standardized capture and ringing protocols ensured
          that field data from mist netting and banding could be rigorously compared between sites.
        </p>

        <p>
          The refined Urbanization Index markedly improved our ability to discriminate between urban,
          peri-urban, and rural contexts. This allowed us to test hypotheses about how
          urbanization-driven changes in habitat structure affect bird condition, survival, and
          potential local adaptation.

        <h2>Riparian Forests & Urban Bird Diversity</h2>

        <p>
          For the Santa Catarina River in Monterrey, I studied how
          <strong>riparian forest structure</strong> within a heavily modified urban corridor influences
          bird diversity and community composition. Following extreme disturbance events, this riverbed
          has evolved into a mosaic of successional habitats, providing an opportunity to evaluate how
          vegetation recovery affects avian communities.
        </p>

        <p>
          I processed multispectral satellite imagery to derive vegetation indices (e.g. NDVI) and to
          map land cover classes along the river. These spatial layers were paired with standardized
          point-count surveys to model richness and functional diversity as a function of canopy cover,
          patch connectivity, and surrounding urbanization.
        </p>

        <p>
          The analysis highlighted riparian segments where regenerating vegetation disproportionately
          supports bird diversity, providing an evidence base for maintaining or restoring forested
          strips as part of urban planning and disaster recovery strategies.
        </p>

        <h2>Remote Sensing for Reforestation Monitoring</h2>
        <p class="project-meta">

        </p>

        <p>
          At Enel Green Power, I supported <strong>reforestation monitoring</strong> for renewable
          energy projects by combining field surveys with satellite-based vegetation analysis. A major
          challenge was turning heterogeneous, site-level observations into analysis-ready data that
          could be compared across multiple projects and years.
        </p>

        <p>
          I built reproducible pipelines in R to clean and standardize field data from large mammal and
          endangered species surveys, reducing processing times from several days to a single day. These
          datasets were then aligned with remote sensing products tracking vegetation cover, growth
          dynamics, and habitat condition within compensation and restoration areas.
        </p>

        <p>
          The result was a suite of indicators that allowed environmental teams to evaluate whether
          commitments on reforestation and biodiversity were being met, and to prioritize sites where
          additional interventions might be needed.

        </p>

        <p>
          As project manager at IRCA Consultants, I design and oversee <strong>drone-based
          photogrammetry</strong> and GIS workflows for environmental compensation projects. These
          projects often involve monitoring forest cover, erosion, and soil recovery following
          infrastructure development.
        </p>

        <p>
          Using UAV imagery, I generate orthomosaics and digital surface models that provide
          high-resolution baselines for tracking structural changes in vegetation and terrain. I then
          implement ModelBuilder and Python-based tools in ArcGIS Pro to segment forest patches, derive
          canopy metrics, and quantify change over time.
        </p>

        <p>
          Combining this with regulatory requirements and on-the-ground observations allows us to
          document compliance, identify areas that lag behind restoration targets, and recommend
          actionable measures to improve ecological outcomes.

        </p>

        <p>
          For a housing development project, I carried out a <strong>historical vegetation and surface
          water analysis</strong> using NDVI and NWI. The aim was to understand how vegetation and
          wetland-like conditions had changed over time within and around the proposed development
          footprint.
        </p>

        <p>
          I processed multispectral imagery from multiple dates, generating NDVI and NWI layers to
          highlight persistent vegetation, ephemeral water bodies, and areas sensitive to disturbance.
          These were integrated with field visits, interviews with local residents, and observations of
          flora and fauna.
        </p>

        <p>
          The final maps informed layout decisions, helping to avoid the most sensitive zones, maintain
          drainage patterns, and incorporate green spaces that retain some of the site’s original
          ecological functions.

        <p>
          In San Pedro Garza García, I helped standardize and analyze biodiversity monitoring efforts
          across a network of urban parks. Each park collected data using slightly different methods,
          making it challenging to compare biodiversity indicators across the system.
        </p>

        <p>
          I worked with the ecology team to harmonize survey protocols and to design a set of
          biodiversity metrics that could be computed consistently, including species richness, relative
          abundance, and functional group composition. Spatial data on park structure and connectivity
          provided additional context for interpreting these indicators.
        </p>

        <p>
          This work contributed to a monitoring framework aligned with urban sustainability goals and
          SDG 11, giving decision-makers clearer signals about where management actions have the
          greatest ecological payoff.
